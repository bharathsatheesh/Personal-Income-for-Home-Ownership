README: HOMEWORK 05


PREPROCESSING
If using the census dataset, then first run the external script by calling string_CVS_read to obtain data and column labels. However, SKIP if using spam dataset (no column labels as well).

The code is the same for both datasets.


RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:
a) Run only HW05 as it will call all the other files. 
b) Run particular(labelled) sections to access the different parts of code.
c) Repeat for the other dataset as well.
d) string_CVS_read should only be called in Census and not spam for preprocessing.

NOTE: If using census dataset, you will need to pass in another argument {column_labels} and add the same to the predict method in the DecisionTree class ( Im sorry! I didn't know how to create default values for functions in MATLAB)
